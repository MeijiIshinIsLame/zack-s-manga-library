Flask app to let me read my manga on the go.

## But, why though?

I like to read my manga in Japanese, and unfortunately there aren't many websites that host non-translated manga.<br><br>
I have a collection of manga on my computer, and it is my hobby to read these during my lunch and dinner breaks.<br>
However, I got tired of having to take my computer everywhere (and with Windows Photos...TT,) so I decided to make this website so I could have my manga in a more readable format.
